# Imad-Milestone3
I've created an arcade type game, where the user must obtain a lost object to progress to harder levels while dodging fatal obstacles along the way. I have changed the life-count to 100 and the jump speed to 16, these would originally be 3 and 12 respectively, this has been done to reduce the difficulty of the game for the markers.
