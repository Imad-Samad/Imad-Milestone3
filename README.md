# Programming in Java: Final Project  
I've created an arcade game in Java, where the user must obtain a lost object to progress to harder levels while dodging fatal obstacles along the way. I have changed the life-count to 100 and the jump speed to 16, these would originally be 3 and 12 respectively, this has been done to reduce the difficulty of the game for the markers. Please feel free to download the zip file containing the game classes to have a look at my code or have a go at the game!
