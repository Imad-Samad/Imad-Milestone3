      <h3>Imad Samad</h3>
      <p> 
 	  I have just successfully completed my Mathematics, Computer Science and Economics A-Levels at 
 	  Graveney School in South London which is where I'm from. I have had a litle bit of programming
      experience during my computer science A-Level, however due to covid, our programming coursework was cancelled, 
      it's also my first time programming in Java. I play a plathora of sports from football to tennis and I am 
      interested in persuring a career in data science, software engineernig or artificial integlligence.  </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 3D Spiral</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates an understanding of 3D shapes
	aswell as the rotate(), translate() and scale() methods. It also shows a comprehensive
	understanding of if statements to allow user interaction. I created a 3D object 
	spiralling towards the middle of itself then expanding outwards creatng a whirlpool 
	effect. It also uses noise() to mimic the movement of a small insect, which is more 
    effective than random() as it gives the object a more organic and natural feel. I've also 
    included some user interaction to change the colour of the object and also the size. 
    The user can press 'r','b','g' or 'p' to change the objects colour to red, blue, green 
    or purple. Also the user can press 'l' or 's' on the keyboard to increase or reduce the 
    size of the object. Finaly the user can press the space bar to pause the movement of the spiral.

	My second programming project, concluding the "IN1007 Programming in Java" module at 
	City (2021). This Java project demonstrates an understanding of the programming concepts 
	taught in the module. My game is inspired by the Donkey Kong arcade game where the main
	character, in my case Roo, has to work it's way up to collect its objective, in my case, 
	Joey. The game contains game music which runs on a loop in the background, aswell as
	sounds upon collision with Joey or a bomb. The Roo is controlled through the keyboard 
	and there is also a GUI containing buttons on the top of the game to quit, pause, 
	resume, save and load. The player has to collect Joey while dodging as many bombs 
	as possible, if the player collides with more than 3 bombs in a level, GAME OVER. 
	The life-count resets when moving to a new level. The game also contains advanced 
	save/load to retain the state of the dynamic objects in a level completely.
